# SmartChat - Frontend

**Welcome to our System!**

We are SmartChat.

SmartChat is a multi-platform AI chatbot integration system, designed to unify and enhance responses from ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Instead of relying on a single AI model, SmartChat utilizes the strengths of each platform by collecting multiple independent answers for every user question.

Once all answers are received, SmartChat applies a **cross-platform evaluation mechanism**:  
Each AI platform evaluates the answers generated by the other platforms based on three key metrics — **accuracy, relevance, and clarity** — and assigns numeric scores accordingly. This results in an objective multi-perspective evaluation where models rate each other’s output.

After collecting all evaluations, SmartChat calculates **weighted average scores** for each response. The answer with the highest overall score is selected as the primary base answer.

However, instead of returning the highest-scoring answer directly, SmartChat performs additional analysis by identifying **unique insights** contained in the other non-selected answers. These unique insights are extracted and merged into the primary answer to enrich it with complementary information, resulting in a more comprehensive and well-rounded response.

Finally, SmartChat refines the merged answer based on the user’s personal preferences (answer style, tone, number of examples, etc.) to ensure that the final response is not only factually correct but also tailored to the user’s individual needs.

This multi-stage process ensures that SmartChat delivers answers that are not only accurate and high-quality but also balanced, validated, and personalized, while minimizing model-specific biases or errors.

Developed as part of a Software Engineering B.Sc. Final Project.

> **Before you start**

1. [x] Clone the project from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/asafzaf/SmartChatFront.git`
2. [x] Install all dependencies: `npm install`
3. [x] Ensure you have the `.env` file containing environment variables like `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
4. [x] Start the frontend server: `npm run dev`

> **Frontend Flow**

The frontend handles the following flow:

1. User opens chat interface.
2. User submits a Software Engineering-related question.
3. The question is sent to the backend API.
4. Backend performs merging, scoring, insights extraction, and returns the final answer.
5. Frontend displays the merged answer.
6. User provides feedback (rating and comments).
7. Feedback is sent back to backend for continuous improvement.
8. User preferences can be updated for future answers.
